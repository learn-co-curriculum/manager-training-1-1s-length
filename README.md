# manager-training-1-1s-length

Think about the last time you had a difficult topic to discuss with someone, whether in your personal or professional career. Did you bring it up immediately or did you feel the need to warm up? If you valued the relationship, there’s a good chance you waited.  That’s normal. Somewhere around the 20 to 30 minute mark is when “heart to heart” topics tend to emerge. So even if you are religiously doing 1:1s you may not be getting to the meaty stuff at all if your sessions are not long enough. Try and block 45 minutes to avoid having to cut any conversation short.
